#+TITLE: cg-mwesplit
#+STARTUP: showall

* Description

This program reads input in Constraint Grammar format, and splits
special "multiword cohorts" into separate cohorts, leaving other
cohorts and intervening blanks as they were.

For examples of input/output, see the files in =test/=, e.g.
[[file:input.dalle_go.cg][input.dalle_go.cg]].

* Prerequisites
  A C++ compiler that goes all the way to 11.

  Tested with gcc-5.2.0, gcc-5.3.1 and clang-703.0.29.

* Building

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./autogen.sh
./configure  # optionally with argument --prefix=$HOME/my/prefix
make
make install # with sudo if you didn't specify a prefix
#+END_SRC

* Usage

  Takes no options, just stdin and stdout:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cg-mwesplit < infile > outfile
#+END_SRC

More typically, it'll be in a pipeline after =hfst-tokenise= and some
step that disambiguates multiwords using =vislcg3=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo words go here | hfst-tokenise -wacku: tokeniser.pmhfst | vislcg3 -g mwe-dis.cg3 | cg-mwesplit
#+END_SRC
